<h1 align="center">FajrOS (فجر)</h1>

## Introduction
Welcome to FajrOS, an educational operating system project. "Fajr" (فجر), an Arabic word meaning dawn, aptly symbolizes the fresh start and the first light of understanding in the world of operating system development. FajrOS is primarily a personal learning and exploration tool in the domain of OS development.

## Project Overview
FajrOS is a basic, educational operating system built from the ground up. It serves as an ideal starting point for those interested in delving into the intricacies of how operating systems work at a fundamental level.

## Inspiration and Resources
This project is inspired by and draws knowledge from two main sources:
- "Writing a Simple Operating System —  from Scratch" by Nick Blundell, a comprehensive guide on the basics of building an operating system from scratch.
- The [Lost Streams](https://codeberg.org/blau_araujo/lost) project by Blau Araujo, documented on [blauaraujo.com](https://blauaraujo.com/). This resource offers practical insights and examples in OS development.

## Goals
The goal of FajrOS is straightforward – to build a minimal but functional operating system, serving as a practical tool for my own learning and curiosity in system programming and low-level software architecture.

## Getting Started
To begin exploring FajrOS:
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Follow the building instructions in the documentation to compile and run FajrOS on your machine.

## License
FajrOS is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0, promoting open and collaborative development while ensuring freedom of use and modification.
